## Hyprland for Void Linux

This repository contains template files and binaries for building or installing [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) on Void Linux.

### Installation

The easiest way to install Hyprland on Void Linux is using the [repository](https://github.com/Makrennel/hyprland-void/tree/repository-x86_64-glibc) which consists of binaries built automatically using GitHub Actions whenever a new commit is pushed.

You can add this repository to xbps's repositories by creating a file such as `/etc/xbps.d/hyprland-void.conf` with the following text:

```
repository=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Makrennel/hyprland-void/repository-x86_64-glibc
```

You should then be able to install hyprland like you would any other program:

```
sudo xbps-install -S hyprland
```

You can also search through all hypr related packages as you would any other (you will need to accept the repository's fingerprint first with `xbps-install -S`)

```
xbps-query -Rs hypr
```

Currently this repository provides binary packages for:

- x86_64-glibc
- x86_64-musl

Change the end of the url at `/etc/xbps.d/hyprland-void.conf` as appropriate with the above options.

### Running

In order to run Hyprland you will need to install some additional packages which will depend on your setup, for example a [session and seat manager](https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/session-management.html) and [graphics drivers](https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/graphical-session/graphics-drivers/index.html).

You may also have to add the user to the `_seatd` group.

#### Nvidia

The `hyprland-nvidia` has been removed as it is no longer necessary as of [version 0.33.0](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/releases/tag/v0.33.0). Nvidia support is still unofficial; refer to the [manual](https://wiki.hyprland.org/hyprland-wiki/pages/Nvidia/).

### Nightly

Nightly packages have been removed as of 2024/08/13. They were always a bad idea, and with [newer git versions](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/commit/83a334f97df4389ca30cb63e50317a66a82562b9) of Hyprland after version 0.42.0 requiring GCC 14 which has not yet landed in the hopelessly out of date void-packages repository, it simply doesn't make sense to continue maintaining nightly packages in this repository. If you would like to use git packages for Hypr\*, you would probably be better off building directly [from source](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/#manual-manual-build), or [use Nix](https://nixos.org/download/).

### Extra

There are packages in this repository which may be of interest for:

- hypridle
- hyprlock
- hyprpaper
- xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland

### Manually Building

You may want to build these templates manually, for example if you have a specific configuration requirement that needs to be set at build time. Void-packages may sometimes have specific packages which are out of date from time to time that need to be updated beforehand in order to update Hyprland, which is why this repository is not simply forked off it. We need to copy the modifications from this repository on top of a fresh void-packages clone in order to build manually.

1. You may want to start by making a directory where you can keep the relevant repositories

```
mkdir ~/repos
cd ~/repos
```

2. Set up a [void-packages](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages) clone for building templates files

```
git clone https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages
cd void-packages
./xbps-src binary-bootstrap
cd ..
```

3. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Makrennel/hyprland-void.git
cd hyprland-void
```

4. Append shared libraries to the end of your void-packages shared libraries

```
cat common/shlibs >> ../void-packages/common/shlibs
```

5. Copy clang build helper to your void-packages common/build-helper directory

```
cp -rf common/build-helper/clang.sh ../void-packages/common/build-helper/
```

6. Copy srcpkgs to your void-packages srcpkgs directory

```
cp -r --remove-destination srcpkgs/* ../void-packages/srcpkgs
```

7. Build and install packages

```
cd ../void-packages
./xbps-src pkg hyprland
sudo xbps-install -R hostdir/binpkgs hyprland
```
